## Summary: Gobo doesn't do anything strange with your data

**Last updated May 12, 2025**

Gobo Inc. ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://gobo.social website and software-as-a-service application (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### Cross-Posts
When you cross-post with Gobo, the content you publish and any associated metadata will be sent to the external social media platforms you designate as targets for the post.

### Reactions
When you react to content (e.g., like, repost) with Gobo, your reaction will be sent to the appropriate external platforms. The reaction will not be directly shared on Gobo.

### Identities
Gobo will access and store information from your identities on external platforms that you connect to Gobo, such as your username and social graph, in order to provide the core functionality of the site.

### Feed
Gobo will access, store, and analyze content from your social graphs on external platforms that you connect to Gobo in order to construct your feed.

### Profile
Gobo will store your email address and a profile configuration (e.g., custom name, default theme) to enable you to log in to the site and customize your experience.

### Lenses
Gobo will store lens configurations that you create, and access, store, and analyze content from your social graphs on external platforms that you connect to Gobo in order to provide custom feed algorithms.

### Cookies
Outseta and external platforms you’ve connected to your Gobo account will set cookies in order to facilitate authentication and authorization. For details about cookies from external platforms, please check their privacy policies.

### Payment Data
We collect data necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your credit card number and the security code associated with it. All payment data is stored by Stripe. You may find their privacy policy here: https://stripe.com.

### Credentials and Personal Information
Gobo shares your email address and similar profile data with Outseta so Outseta can provide authentication, authorization, and CRM services for Gobo. Outseta will also store your password and other authentication and authorization data (e.g., roles).

### How Long We Retain Your Data
We store your profile data (e.g., email), identity information (e.g., username), social graphs, and lens configurations (e.g., keyword block targets) for as long as you have an account. We store content and reaction data for 14 days. We may store cross-posts for up to as long as you have an account, though it may be periodically deleted.

### Opting Out of Email Marketing 
You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list—however, we will still need to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account.

### What Rights You Have Over Your Data
You can update, delete, and export your account.

### My Follower Uses Gobo. I Never Consented to Gobo Processing My Data!
We believe your follower has a legitimate interest in choosing how to interact with the social media platforms they are a part of. Therefore, we think Gobo has a legitimate interest in processing your data (as long as we comply with the informational norms of the platform your data is coming from). This essay explains the idea in [more detail](https://techpolicy.press/a-better-approach-to-privacy-for-third-party-social-media-tools/). 

Note, that Gobo does not support content deletion mirroring. So if you post something on a platform that Gobo connects to and later delete the post, your followers who are Gobo users may be able to view the post on Gobo after you delete it. However, Gobo only retains content for 14 days, minimizing the time that this discrepancy can exist.
