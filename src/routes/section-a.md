## What makes Gobo different?

Email platforms have been in a weird place lately. Platforms grow and stop supporting you. Or they’ll shut down, despite the fact that you need your email to work like it’s a utility that you can depend on. Or they’ll hike their fees, forcing you to go through a stressful migration. Or they’ll add dozens of features that you’ll never want to use. Or they’ll just turn flatly evil.

Email should theoretically be easy: write something, send it, repeat. And that’s how it usually is – until it’s not. Turns out email is only hard when other people make it hard.

We don’t. We won’t.

What if your email provider actually wanted you to succeed, and wasn’t trying to slowly bleed you dry? What if your email provider didn’t change to support a few rich customers? Or they just stuck around at all?

What if you felt good about sending your newsletter?

That’s where we come in.
